#  Learning Management System (LMS) SQL Project

## Overview
This project implements a **Learning Management System (LMS)** database using **Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)**.  
It focuses on **relational database design**, **data integrity enforcement**, **transaction handling**, and **analytical SQL queries** commonly used in real-world applications.

The project is designed as a **practice-oriented SQL assignment** to strengthen understanding of:
- Relational data modeling
- Query optimization
- Constraints and triggers
- Transactions and concurrency
- Scalability and performance trade-offs

## Database Schema Overview

The LMS schema consists of the following core entities:

- **Users**: learners and instructors  
- **Courses**: created by instructors, contain lessons and assessments  
- **Lessons**: learning units within a course  
- **Enrollments**: users enrolled in courses  
- **UserActivity**: tracks user interactions with lessons  
- **Assessments**: evaluations linked to courses  
- **AssessmentSubmissions**: user submissions with scores  

###  Key Relationships
- Users can enroll in multiple courses
- Courses contain multiple lessons and assessments
- Users perform activities on lessons
- Users submit assessments and receive scores

Understanding these relationships is essential before writing queries.

##  Technologies Used

- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (T-SQL)
- **Schema Design**: Normalized relational schema
- **SQL Features**:
  - Constraints (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, `CHECK`)
  - Triggers (`AFTER INSERT`, `AFTER UPDATE`)
  - Transactions (`BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`)
  - Window Functions and CTEs
  - Indexing and performance tuning

---

##  Section 1: Intermediate SQL Queries

- Users enrolled in more than three courses
- Courses with no enrollments
- Total number of enrolled users per course
- Users enrolled but never accessed any lesson
- Lessons never accessed by any user
- Last activity timestamp per user
- Users scoring less than 50% in assessments
- Assessments with no submissions
- Highest score per assessment
- Users with inactive enrollments

Each query includes:
- Reason for join choices
- Assumptions made
- Expected behavior on large datasets

---

##  Section 2: Advanced SQL & Analytics

- Course-level aggregates (enrollments, lessons)
- Top three most active users
- Course completion percentage per user
- Users scoring above course average
- Courses with lesson activity but no assessment attempts
- Ranking users within each course by total score
- First lesson accessed by each user per course
- Users active for at least five consecutive days
- Enrolled users with no assessment submissions
- Courses where all enrolled users submitted assessments

Advanced SQL concepts used:
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Window functions (`RANK`, `AVG OVER`)
- Aggregations and filtering
- Time-based analysis

---

##  Section 3: Performance & Optimization

- Indexing strategies for:
  - Course dashboards
  - User activity analytics
- Identification of performance bottlenecks
- Query optimization for large `UserActivity` tables
- Use cases for materialized views
- Partitioning strategies for high-volume activity data

---

##  Section 4: Data Integrity & Constraints

- Prevent duplicate assessment submissions
- Validate assessment scores against maximum marks
- Prevent enrollment into courses without lessons
- Restrict course creation to instructors only
- Safe course deletion using soft deletes and archiving

All rules are enforced at the **database level** to ensure data integrity.

---

##  Section 5: Transactions & Concurrency

- Transaction flow for course enrollment
- Safe handling of concurrent assessment submissions
- Managing partial failures with rollback strategies
- Recommended isolation levels for different operations
- Preventing phantom reads in analytics queries

---

##  Section 6: Database Design & Architecture

- Schema extensions for course completion certificates
- Efficient video progress tracking at scale
- Normalization vs denormalization trade-offs
- Reporting-friendly schema design
- Strategy for scaling the system to millions of users
